# Hi Calista! 

**How’s everything going?** Hope you’re doing great!

I’m really looking forward to diving into your class. Over the summer, I’ve been trying to teach myself **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS,** and **Bootstrap**. I wouldn’t say I’m a pro yet (*at all lol*), but I’m eager to keep practicing my skills and maybe even bring some of that into our projects (*along with the inevitable bugs, of course!*).

---

### Quick question:

For our group projects, is it okay if we explore beyond Python and JavaScript, or should we stick to the usual suspects?

---

Can’t wait to learn a ton and hopefully have a few *“aha”* moments along the way!

See you next class,  
**-David**
